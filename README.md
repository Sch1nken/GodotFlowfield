# GodotFlowfield
A Flowfield Pathfinding implementation for Godot. It is very barebones and was only used in my currently on-hold tower-defense game.

Some limitations:
- No variable costs
- No negative costs
- Only works in positive coordinates (0,0 -> towards positive) due to naive array access for speedup
- Quite optimized

I'll try to provide a simple documentation sometime, along with some videos of it in action.
